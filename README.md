## 🔮 Why We Built This

As validators ourselves, we were often left guessing. Solana's data was out there — but fragmented, raw, and difficult to act on.

We needed a **clear, visual, and intuitive understanding** of how stake flows across the network.

So we built it.

> The **Solana Stake Flow Visualizer** is your compass in the staking ocean — helping validators grow, delegators optimize, and the entire ecosystem thrive.

## ✨ What Makes It Special

### 🎨 Beautiful, Dynamic Visualizations
Visualize the movement of stake like never before — animated flows, gradient timelines, and intuitive charts that reveal what the naked eye can’t.

### 📊 Real-Time Stake Movement Insights
See **how stake is shifting**, **who’s gaining trust**, and **why** — with real data, live.

### 🧠 Intelligent Delegator Support
Get personalized validator suggestions based on your goals, values, and risk profile.

### 🏁 Validator Health Dashboard
Benchmark yourself against the network and make data-backed decisions to **improve retention and growth**.

### 📆 Historical Stake Behavior
Zoom out. Discover long-term trust trends, validator consistency, and early signs of systemic shifts.
